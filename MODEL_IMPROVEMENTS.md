# SR3-XCT Model Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the SR3 super-resolution model for soil CT imaging. All improvements are designed to enhance model performance, training stability, and output quality.

## 1. Enhanced Loss Functions

### 1.1 Perceptual Loss (VGG-based)
**File:** `model/sr3_modules/diffusion.py`

**Changes:**
- **Enabled** the previously commented-out perceptual loss (line 71, 311)
- Uses VGG19 adapted for grayscale images to extract deep features
- Adds feature-level similarity matching between generated and ground truth images
- **Weight:** 0.01 (balanced to avoid overpowering L1 loss)

**Benefits:**
- Better preservation of high-level features and textures
- More realistic and visually pleasing results
- Improved structural coherence in generated images

### 1.2 Multi-scale Loss
**File:** `model/sr3_modules/diffusion.py`

**Changes:**
- **Enabled** multi-scale loss computation (line 314)
- Computes reconstruction loss at multiple scales (1.0x, 0.5x, 0.25x)
- Uses bicubic interpolation for downsampling
- **Weight:** 0.01

**Benefits:**
- Better preservation of details at different scales
- Improved global structure consistency
- Enhanced feature matching across resolution levels

### 1.3 Enhanced Loss Combination
**Total Loss Formula:**
```
g_loss = L1_loss + 0.05 * SSIM_loss + 0.01 * Perceptual_loss + 0.01 * Multi_scale_loss
```

**Rationale:**
- L1 (primary): Pixel-level reconstruction accuracy
- SSIM (0.05): Structural similarity preservation
- Perceptual (0.01): Feature-level matching
- Multi-scale (0.01): Cross-scale consistency

## 2. Learning Rate Scheduling

### 2.1 Cosine Annealing Scheduler
**File:** `model/model.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `CosineAnnealingLR` scheduler (lines 42-48)
- Gradually reduces learning rate from initial value to 1% minimum
- Scheduler state saved/loaded with checkpoints (lines 159-163, 210-223)
- Learning rate logged during training (line 75)

**Configuration:**
```python
torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(
    optimizer,
    T_max=n_iterations,
    eta_min=initial_lr * 0.01
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Better convergence in later training stages
- Reduced risk of overshooting optimal parameters
- Improved final model quality
- Standard practice in modern deep learning

---

## 3. Cross-Attention Architecture Enhancement

### 3.1 New Cross-Attention Module
**File:** `model/sr3_modules/unet.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `CrossAttention` class (lines 145-196)
- Implements attention mechanism between main features and LR conditioning
- Uses separate Query (from features), Key & Value (from context)
- Multi-head attention with 4 heads by default

**Architecture:**
```
CrossAttention(
    in_channel: main feature channels
    context_channel: conditioning feature channels
    n_head: 4 (default)
    norm_groups: 32 (default)
)
```

### 3.2 UNet Modifications
**Changes:**
1. Added `use_cross_attn` parameter (default: True) (line 233)
2. Added condition encoder for LR images (lines 258-260)
3. Integrated cross-attention into encoder, bottleneck, and decoder (lines 268-272, 283, 295-298)
4. Modified forward pass to extract and propagate context (lines 312-318)

**Integration Points:**
- Encoder: Cross-attention at attention resolutions
- Bottleneck: Cross-attention in first block
- Decoder: Cross-attention at attention resolutions

**Benefits:**
- Better fusion of LR conditioning with noisy features
- Improved feature alignment between input and target
- More effective use of conditioning information
- Enhanced detail preservation from LR input

## 4. Advanced Data Augmentation

### 4.1 Enhanced Augmentation Pipeline
**File:** `data/util.py`

**Original Augmentations:**
- Horizontal flip (50% probability)
- Vertical flip (50% probability)
- 90-degree rotation (50% probability)

**New Augmentations (Training Only):**

1. **Gaussian Noise** (30% probability)
   - Simulates CT scanning noise
   - Noise std: 0.01 to 0.05
   - Improves robustness to noisy inputs

2. **Gaussian Blur** (20% probability)
   - Simulates different scanning resolutions
   - Sigma range: 0.3 to 0.8
   - Uses scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter

3. **Intensity Adjustment** (30% probability)
   - Simulates different scanning parameters
   - Contrast (alpha): 0.85 to 1.15
   - Brightness (beta): -0.1 to 0.1
   - Improves generalization across scanners

**Benefits:**
- Better generalization to real-world scanning variations
- Improved robustness to noise and artifacts
- Enhanced model ability to handle diverse input conditions
- More realistic training data distribution

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Files Modified
1. `model/sr3_modules/diffusion.py` - Loss functions
2. `model/sr3_modules/unet.py` - Cross-attention architecture
3. `model/model.py` - Learning rate scheduling
4. `data/util.py` - Data augmentation

### 5.2 Backward Compatibility
- All changes are backward compatible with existing configs
- Scheduler state loading handles missing scheduler files gracefully
- Cross-attention can be disabled by setting `use_cross_attn=False`
- Augmentations only apply during training (split='train')

### 5.3 Configuration Requirements
- No config file changes required for basic usage
- Learning rate scheduling uses existing `n_iter` parameter
- Cross-attention uses default parameters from UNet config

## 11. Troubleshooting

### 11.1 Common Issues

**Issue:** Out of memory errors
- **Solution:** Cross-attention adds memory overhead; reduce batch size by 20-30%

**Issue:** Slower training speed
- **Solution:** VGG perceptual loss and cross-attention add compute; expected 15-25% slowdown

**Issue:** Loss becomes NaN
- **Solution:** Reduce perceptual/multi-scale loss weights; check for extreme augmentation values

### 11.2 Hyperparameter Tuning

If results are suboptimal, try adjusting:
- Perceptual loss weight: 0.005 to 0.02
- Multi-scale loss weight: 0.005 to 0.02
- Learning rate minimum: 0.001 to 0.05 of initial LR
- Augmentation probabilities: ±10%
